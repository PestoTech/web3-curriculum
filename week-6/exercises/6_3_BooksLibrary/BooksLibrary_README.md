We have already implemented the Books Library in the previous Section. Here we get more accustomed to the hardhat environment

### Things to do

1. Compile your contracts in the hardhat environment
2. Add unit test cases
3. Check for coverage and improve on coverage to the max possible
4. Generate gas consumption report
5. Check for differences with optimization enabled vs disabled
